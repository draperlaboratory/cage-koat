YES(?, 1000000)

Initial complexity problem:
1:	T:
		(Comp: 1, Cost: 1)    f(x) -> Com_1(g(0))
		(Comp: ?, Cost: 1)    g(x) -> Com_1(g(x + 1)) [ x < 999999 ]
	start location:	f
	leaf cost:	0

A polynomial rank function with
	Pol(f) = 999999
	Pol(g) = -V_1 + 999999
orients all transitions weakly and the transition
	g(x) -> Com_1(g(x + 1)) [ x < 999999 ]
strictly and produces the following problem:
2:	T:
		(Comp: 1, Cost: 1)         f(x) -> Com_1(g(0))
		(Comp: 999999, Cost: 1)    g(x) -> Com_1(g(x + 1)) [ x < 999999 ]
	start location:	f
	leaf cost:	0

Complexity upper bound 1000000
