YES(?, 3)

Initial complexity problem:
1:	T:
		(1, 1)    start(a) -> Com_1(one(a))
		(?, 1)    one(a) -> Com_1(two(a))
		(?, 1)    two(a) -> Com_1(three(a))
		(?, 1)    three(a) -> Com_1(four(a))
	start location:	start
	leaf cost:	0

Repeatedly propagating knowledge in problem 1 produces the following problem:
2:	T:
		(1, 1)    start(a) -> Com_1(one(a))
		(1, 1)    one(a) -> Com_1(two(a))
		(1, 1)    two(a) -> Com_1(three(a))
		(1, 1)    three(a) -> Com_1(four(a))
	start location:	start
	leaf cost:	0

Complexity upper bound 3
