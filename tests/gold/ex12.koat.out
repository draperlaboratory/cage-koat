YES(?, 101)

Initial complexity problem:
1:	T:
		(Comp: 1, Cost: 1)    f(x) -> Com_1(g(100))
		(Comp: ?, Cost: 1)    g(x) -> Com_1(g(x - 1)) [ x > 0 ]
	start location:	f
	leaf cost:	0

A polynomial rank function with
	Pol(f) = 100
	Pol(g) = V_1
orients all transitions weakly and the transition
	g(x) -> Com_1(g(x - 1)) [ x > 0 ]
strictly and produces the following problem:
2:	T:
		(Comp: 1, Cost: 1)      f(x) -> Com_1(g(100))
		(Comp: 100, Cost: 1)    g(x) -> Com_1(g(x - 1)) [ x > 0 ]
	start location:	f
	leaf cost:	0

Complexity upper bound 101
