YES(?, n + j + 1)

Initial complexity problem:
1:	T:
		(Comp: 1, Cost: 1)    start(n, i, j) -> Com_1(bb2(n, i, j))
		(Comp: ?, Cost: 1)    bb2(n, i, j) -> Com_1(bb2(n, i, j + 1)) [ j < n /\ n >= 0 ]
	start location:	start
	leaf cost:	0

A polynomial rank function with
	Pol(start) = V_1 - V_3
	Pol(bb2) = V_1 - V_3
orients all transitions weakly and the transition
	bb2(n, i, j) -> Com_1(bb2(n, i, j + 1)) [ j < n /\ n >= 0 ]
strictly and produces the following problem:
2:	T:
		(Comp: 1, Cost: 1)        start(n, i, j) -> Com_1(bb2(n, i, j))
		(Comp: n + j, Cost: 1)    bb2(n, i, j) -> Com_1(bb2(n, i, j + 1)) [ j < n /\ n >= 0 ]
	start location:	start
	leaf cost:	0

Complexity upper bound n + j + 1
