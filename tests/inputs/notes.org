* Testing Notes
** APRON, Z3
   Outputs differ measurably depending on if Z3, apron, or both are enabled in
   the makefile.  Currently the golden outputs rely on both of them being
   turned on.

* cexamples
  originally shipped with the master branch of kittel / koat.   Example systems of the sort
  kittel is able to handle.

* debugExamples

  Meant to provide simple test cases for the most basic functionailty
  of various kittel / koat components, such as the parser, the visualizer, etc.

* weightedExamples
  Examples meant to put the weigth code through it's paces, check
  extreme situations for correct behavior, etc.

** badExamples
   These exmples should all crash for some reason or another.

** constantWeights
   All weights are constant integers.

** simplePolyWeights
   Weights are simple polynomials, e.g. one unknown such as x^2 + x, rather than x * y.
