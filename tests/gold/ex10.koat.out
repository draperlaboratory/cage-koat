YES(?, x + 4)

Initial complexity problem:
1:	T:
		(Comp: 1, Cost: 1)    f(x) -> Com_1(g(x))
		(Comp: ?, Cost: 1)    g(x) -> Com_1(h(x^17)) [ x < 0 ]
		(Comp: ?, Cost: 1)    g(x) -> Com_1(i(x)) [ x >= 0 ]
		(Comp: ?, Cost: 1)    i(x) -> Com_1(i(x - 1)) [ x >= 0 ]
	start location:	f
	leaf cost:	0

Repeatedly propagating knowledge in problem 1 produces the following problem:
2:	T:
		(Comp: 1, Cost: 1)    f(x) -> Com_1(g(x))
		(Comp: 1, Cost: 1)    g(x) -> Com_1(h(x^17)) [ x < 0 ]
		(Comp: 1, Cost: 1)    g(x) -> Com_1(i(x)) [ x >= 0 ]
		(Comp: ?, Cost: 1)    i(x) -> Com_1(i(x - 1)) [ x >= 0 ]
	start location:	f
	leaf cost:	0

A polynomial rank function with
	Pol(i) = V_1 + 1
and size complexities
	S("i(x) -> Com_1(i(x - 1)) [ x >= 0 ]", 0-0) = x + 1
	S("g(x) -> Com_1(i(x)) [ x >= 0 ]", 0-0) = x
	S("g(x) -> Com_1(h(x^17)) [ x < 0 ]", 0-0) = x^17
	S("f(x) -> Com_1(g(x))", 0-0) = x
orients the transitions
	i(x) -> Com_1(i(x - 1)) [ x >= 0 ]
weakly and the transition
	i(x) -> Com_1(i(x - 1)) [ x >= 0 ]
strictly and produces the following problem:
3:	T:
		(Comp: 1, Cost: 1)        f(x) -> Com_1(g(x))
		(Comp: 1, Cost: 1)        g(x) -> Com_1(h(x^17)) [ x < 0 ]
		(Comp: 1, Cost: 1)        g(x) -> Com_1(i(x)) [ x >= 0 ]
		(Comp: x + 1, Cost: 1)    i(x) -> Com_1(i(x - 1)) [ x >= 0 ]
	start location:	f
	leaf cost:	0
