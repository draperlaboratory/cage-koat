YES(?, n + i + 1)

Initial complexity problem:
1:	T:
		(Comp: 1, Cost: 1)    start(n, i) -> Com_1(bb4(n, i))
		(Comp: ?, Cost: 1)    bb4(n, i) -> Com_1(bb4(n, i + 1)) [ i < n /\ n >= 0 ]
	start location:	start
	leaf cost:	0

A polynomial rank function with
	Pol(start) = V_1 - V_2
	Pol(bb4) = V_1 - V_2
orients all transitions weakly and the transition
	bb4(n, i) -> Com_1(bb4(n, i + 1)) [ i < n /\ n >= 0 ]
strictly and produces the following problem:
2:	T:
		(Comp: 1, Cost: 1)        start(n, i) -> Com_1(bb4(n, i))
		(Comp: n + i, Cost: 1)    bb4(n, i) -> Com_1(bb4(n, i + 1)) [ i < n /\ n >= 0 ]
	start location:	start
	leaf cost:	0

Complexity upper bound n + i + 1
