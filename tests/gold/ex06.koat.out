YES(?, x + 1)

Initial complexity problem:
1:	T:
		(Comp: 1, Cost: 1)    f(x) -> Com_1(g(x))
		(Comp: ?, Cost: 1)    g(x) -> Com_1(g(x - 1)) [ x > 0 ]
	start location:	f
	leaf cost:	0

A polynomial rank function with
	Pol(f) = V_1
	Pol(g) = V_1
orients all transitions weakly and the transition
	g(x) -> Com_1(g(x - 1)) [ x > 0 ]
strictly and produces the following problem:
2:	T:
		(Comp: 1, Cost: 1)    f(x) -> Com_1(g(x))
		(Comp: x, Cost: 1)    g(x) -> Com_1(g(x - 1)) [ x > 0 ]
	start location:	f
	leaf cost:	0

Complexity upper bound x + 1
