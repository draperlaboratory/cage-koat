YES(?, x + x^2 + 1)

Initial complexity problem:
1:	T:
		(Comp: 1, Cost: 1)    start(x) -> Com_1(f(x))
		(Comp: ?, Cost: 1)    f(x) -> Com_2(f(x - 1), g(x)) [ x > 0 ]
		(Comp: ?, Cost: 1)    g(x) -> Com_1(g(x - 1)) [ x > 0 ]
	start location:	start
	leaf cost:	0

A polynomial rank function with
	Pol(start) = V_1
	Pol(f) = V_1
	Pol(g) = 0
orients all transitions weakly and the transition
	f(x) -> Com_2(f(x - 1), g(x)) [ x > 0 ]
strictly and produces the following problem:
2:	T:
		(Comp: 1, Cost: 1)    start(x) -> Com_1(f(x))
		(Comp: x, Cost: 1)    f(x) -> Com_2(f(x - 1), g(x)) [ x > 0 ]
		(Comp: ?, Cost: 1)    g(x) -> Com_1(g(x - 1)) [ x > 0 ]
	start location:	start
	leaf cost:	0

	Pol(g) = V_1
and size complexities
	S("g(x) -> Com_1(g(x - 1)) [ x > 0 ]", 0-0) = x
	S("f(x) -> Com_2(f(x - 1), g(x)) [ x > 0 ]", 0-0) = x
	S("f(x) -> Com_2(f(x - 1), g(x)) [ x > 0 ]", 1-0) = x
	S("start(x) -> Com_1(f(x))", 0-0) = x
orients the transitions
	g(x) -> Com_1(g(x - 1)) [ x > 0 ]
weakly and the transition
	g(x) -> Com_1(g(x - 1)) [ x > 0 ]
strictly and produces the following problem:
3:	T:

		(Comp: x, Cost: 1)      f(x) -> Com_2(f(x - 1), g(x)) [ x > 0 ]
