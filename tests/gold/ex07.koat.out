YES(?, x^3)

Initial complexity problem:
1:	T:
		(1, 1)    f(x) -> Com_1(g(x^3))
		(?, 1)    g(x) -> Com_1(g(x - 1)) [ x > 0 ]
	start location:	f
	leaf cost:	0

A polynomial rank function with
	Pol(g) = V_1
and size complexities
	S("g(x) -> Com_1(g(x - 1)) [ x > 0 ]", 0-0) = x^3
	S("f(x) -> Com_1(g(x^3))", 0-0) = x^3
orients the transitions
	g(x) -> Com_1(g(x - 1)) [ x > 0 ]
weakly and the transition
	g(x) -> Com_1(g(x - 1)) [ x > 0 ]
strictly and produces the following problem:
2:	T:
		(1, 1)      f(x) -> Com_1(g(x^3))
		(x^3, 1)    g(x) -> Com_1(g(x - 1)) [ x > 0 ]
	start location:	f
	leaf cost:	0

Complexity upper bound x^3
