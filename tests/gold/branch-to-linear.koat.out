Initial complexity problem:
1:	T:
		(1, 1)    start(a, b) -> Com_1(one(a, b))
		(?, 1)    one(a, b) -> Com_1(two(a, b))
		(?, 1)    two(a, b) -> Com_1(three(a, b))
		(?, 1)    three(a, b) -> Com_1(four(a, b))
		(?, 1)    four(a, b) -> Com_1(leftOne(a, b)) [ a > b ]
		(?, 1)    four(a, b) -> Com_1(rightOne(a, b)) [ a <= b ]
		(?, 1)    leftOne(a, b) -> Com_1(leftTwo(a, b))
		(?, 1)    leftTwo(a, b) -> Com_1(leftThree(a, b))
		(?, 1)    leftThree(a, b) -> Com_1(leftFour(a, b))
		(?, 1)    rightOne(a, b) -> Com_1(rightTwo(a, b))
		(?, 1)    rightTwo(a, b) -> Com_1(rightThree(a, b))
		(?, 1)    rightThree(a, b) -> Com_1(rightFour(a, b))

Repeatedly propagating knowledge in problem 1 produces the following problem:
2:	T:
		(1, 1)    start(a, b) -> Com_1(one(a, b))
		(1, 1)    one(a, b) -> Com_1(two(a, b))
		(1, 1)    two(a, b) -> Com_1(three(a, b))
		(1, 1)    three(a, b) -> Com_1(four(a, b))
		(1, 1)    four(a, b) -> Com_1(leftOne(a, b)) [ a > b ]
		(1, 1)    four(a, b) -> Com_1(rightOne(a, b)) [ a <= b ]
		(1, 1)    leftOne(a, b) -> Com_1(leftTwo(a, b))
		(1, 1)    leftTwo(a, b) -> Com_1(leftThree(a, b))
		(1, 1)    leftThree(a, b) -> Com_1(leftFour(a, b))
		(1, 1)    rightOne(a, b) -> Com_1(rightTwo(a, b))
		(1, 1)    rightTwo(a, b) -> Com_1(rightThree(a, b))
