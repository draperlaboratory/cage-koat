YES(?, x + x^2 + 1)

Initial complexity problem:
1:	T:
		(Comp: 1, Cost: 1)    start(x) -> Com_1(facSum(x))
		(Comp: ?, Cost: 1)    facSum(x) -> Com_2(fac(x), facSum(x - 1)) [ x > 0 ]
		(Comp: ?, Cost: 1)    fac(x) -> Com_1(fac(x - 1)) [ x > 0 ]
	start location:	start
	leaf cost:	0

A polynomial rank function with
	Pol(start) = V_1
	Pol(facSum) = V_1
	Pol(fac) = 0
orients all transitions weakly and the transition
	facSum(x) -> Com_2(fac(x), facSum(x - 1)) [ x > 0 ]
strictly and produces the following problem:
2:	T:
		(Comp: 1, Cost: 1)    start(x) -> Com_1(facSum(x))
		(Comp: x, Cost: 1)    facSum(x) -> Com_2(fac(x), facSum(x - 1)) [ x > 0 ]
		(Comp: ?, Cost: 1)    fac(x) -> Com_1(fac(x - 1)) [ x > 0 ]
	start location:	start
	leaf cost:	0

A polynomial rank function with
	Pol(fac) = V_1
and size complexities
	S("fac(x) -> Com_1(fac(x - 1)) [ x > 0 ]", 0-0) = x
	S("facSum(x) -> Com_2(fac(x), facSum(x - 1)) [ x > 0 ]", 0-0) = x
	S("facSum(x) -> Com_2(fac(x), facSum(x - 1)) [ x > 0 ]", 1-0) = x
	S("start(x) -> Com_1(facSum(x))", 0-0) = x
orients the transitions
	fac(x) -> Com_1(fac(x - 1)) [ x > 0 ]
weakly and the transition
	fac(x) -> Com_1(fac(x - 1)) [ x > 0 ]
strictly and produces the following problem:
3:	T:
		(Comp: 1, Cost: 1)      start(x) -> Com_1(facSum(x))
		(Comp: x, Cost: 1)      facSum(x) -> Com_2(fac(x), facSum(x - 1)) [ x > 0 ]
