YES(?, 999999)

Initial complexity problem:
1:	T:
		(1, 1)    f(x) -> Com_1(g(0))
		(?, 1)    g(x) -> Com_1(g(x + 1)) [ x < 999999 ]
	start location:	f
	leaf cost:	0

A polynomial rank function with
	Pol(f) = 999999
	Pol(g) = -V_1 + 999999
orients all transitions weakly and the transition
	g(x) -> Com_1(g(x + 1)) [ x < 999999 ]
strictly and produces the following problem:
2:	T:
		(1, 1)         f(x) -> Com_1(g(0))
		(999999, 1)    g(x) -> Com_1(g(x + 1)) [ x < 999999 ]
	start location:	f
	leaf cost:	0

Complexity upper bound 999999
