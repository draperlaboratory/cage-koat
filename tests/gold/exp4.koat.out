YES(?, pow(2, x + 1) + 2)

Initial complexity problem:
1:	T:
		(Comp: 1, Cost: 1)    f(x) -> Com_1(g(x))
		(Comp: ?, Cost: 1)    g(x) -> Com_2(g(x - 1), g(x - 1)) [ x >= 0 ]
	start location:	f
	leaf cost:	0

By chaining the transition f(x) -> Com_1(g(x)) with all transitions in problem 1, the following new transition is obtained:
	f(x) -> Com_2(g(x - 1), g(x - 1)) [ x >= 0 ]
We thus obtain the following problem:
2:	T:
		(Comp: 1, Cost: 2)    f(x) -> Com_2(g(x - 1), g(x - 1)) [ x >= 0 ]
		(Comp: ?, Cost: 1)    g(x) -> Com_2(g(x - 1), g(x - 1)) [ x >= 0 ]
	start location:	f
	leaf cost:	0

A separated polynomial rank function for exponential bounds with
	Pol(f) = V_1
	Pol(g) = V_1 + 1
orients all transitions weakly and the transition
	g(x) -> Com_2(g(x - 1), g(x - 1)) [ x >= 0 ]
strictly and produces the following problem:
3:	T:
		(Comp: 1, Cost: 2)                f(x) -> Com_2(g(x - 1), g(x - 1)) [ x >= 0 ]
		(Comp: pow(2, x + 1), Cost: 1)    g(x) -> Com_2(g(x - 1), g(x - 1)) [ x >= 0 ]
	start location:	f
	leaf cost:	0
