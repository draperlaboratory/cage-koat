YES(?, x^3 + y^17 + 4)

Initial complexity problem:
1:	T:
		(Comp: 1, Cost: 1)    f1(x, y) -> Com_1(f2(x^3, y))
		(Comp: ?, Cost: 1)    f2(x, y) -> Com_1(f3(x, y^17))
		(Comp: ?, Cost: 1)    f3(x, y) -> Com_1(f4(x, y))
		(Comp: ?, Cost: 1)    f4(x, y) -> Com_1(g(x, y))
		(Comp: ?, Cost: 1)    g(x, y) -> Com_1(g(x + 1, y)) [ x < y ]
	start location:	f1
	leaf cost:	0

Repeatedly propagating knowledge in problem 1 produces the following problem:
2:	T:
		(Comp: 1, Cost: 1)    f1(x, y) -> Com_1(f2(x^3, y))
		(Comp: 1, Cost: 1)    f2(x, y) -> Com_1(f3(x, y^17))
		(Comp: 1, Cost: 1)    f3(x, y) -> Com_1(f4(x, y))
		(Comp: 1, Cost: 1)    f4(x, y) -> Com_1(g(x, y))
		(Comp: ?, Cost: 1)    g(x, y) -> Com_1(g(x + 1, y)) [ x < y ]
	start location:	f1

A polynomial rank function with
	Pol(g) = -V_1 + V_2

	S("g(x, y) -> Com_1(g(x + 1, y)) [ x < y ]", 0-0) = ?
	S("g(x, y) -> Com_1(g(x + 1, y)) [ x < y ]", 0-1) = y^17

	S("f4(x, y) -> Com_1(g(x, y))", 0-1) = y^17
	S("f3(x, y) -> Com_1(f4(x, y))", 0-0) = x^3
	S("f3(x, y) -> Com_1(f4(x, y))", 0-1) = y^17

	S("f1(x, y) -> Com_1(f2(x^3, y))", 0-1) = y
orients the transitions
	g(x, y) -> Com_1(g(x + 1, y)) [ x < y ]
weakly and the transition
	g(x, y) -> Com_1(g(x + 1, y)) [ x < y ]
strictly and produces the following problem:
3:	T:

		(Comp: 1, Cost: 1)             f4(x, y) -> Com_1(g(x, y))
		(Comp: x^3 + y^17, Cost: 1)    g(x, y) -> Com_1(g(x + 1, y)) [ x < y ]
