There's a known issue in koat at this point, related to unused variables that appear
across multiple terms.  It's related to inappropriate capture.  We think that
variables with the same name are the same across functions, but we can not actually
know that apriori.

See cage-koat-issue-1 and similar for examples of inputs that tickle this
particular bug.

One would be tempted to think we introduced this bug, but it's a long standing
issue with KoAT. When runing the s-falke branch against these inputs, you see
the same sort of mistakes being made.

This means one of two things: either it's a long standing bug in koat, or there's
some additional semantics for the rules that aren't properly captured by current
documentation.  If it's the former, we just need to find a solution, if it's the
later, we need to write more documentation and place a translation shim between
KoAT and AProVE

The simplest thing we could do fix the issue is just rename all of the
variable in the file so that there are no collissions.  This doesn't
outright fix the issue, of course, it simply hides it.  In the instances we have,
we've tried renaming all of the variables by hand, and that works fine.
We get what appears to be the right answer, probably for the right reason.
