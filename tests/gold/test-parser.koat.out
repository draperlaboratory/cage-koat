YES(?, x^2 + 1)

Initial complexity problem:
1:	T:
		(Comp: 1, Cost: 1)      start(x, y) -> Com_1(g(x, 0))
		(Comp: ?, Cost: x^2)    g(x, y) -> Com_1(f(x, y)) [ x^2 >= x /\ x = 0 ]
		(Comp: ?, Cost: 1)      g(x, y) -> Com_1(g(x - 1, y + x)) [ 1 >= 3*x + 2*y^2 + 17 /\ x > 0 ]
	start location:	start
	leaf cost:	0

Testing for reachability in the complexity graph removes the following transition from problem 1:
	g(x, y) -> Com_1(g(x - 1, y + x)) [ 1 >= 3*x + 2*y^2 + 17 /\ x > 0 ]
We thus obtain the following problem:
2:	T:
		(Comp: ?, Cost: x^2)    g(x, y) -> Com_1(f(x, y)) [ x^2 >= x /\ x = 0 ]
		(Comp: 1, Cost: 1)      start(x, y) -> Com_1(g(x, 0))
	start location:	start
	leaf cost:	0

Repeatedly propagating knowledge in problem 2 produces the following problem:
3:	T:
		(Comp: 1, Cost: x^2)    g(x, y) -> Com_1(f(x, y)) [ x^2 >= x /\ x = 0 ]
		(Comp: 1, Cost: 1)      start(x, y) -> Com_1(g(x, 0))
	start location:	start
	leaf cost:	0

Complexity upper bound x^2 + 1
