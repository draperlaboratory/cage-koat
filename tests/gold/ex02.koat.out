Initial complexity problem:
1:	T:
		(1, 1)    start(x, y) -> Com_1(f(x, y))
		(?, 1)    f(x, y) -> Com_1(f(x - 1, y)) [ x > 0 ]

A polynomial rank function with
	Pol(start) = 3*V_2 - 1
	Pol(f) = 3*V_2 - 1
	Pol(g) = 3*V_2 - 2
orients all transitions weakly and the transition
	g(x, y) -> Com_1(g(x, y - 1)) [ y > 0 ]
strictly and produces the following problem:
