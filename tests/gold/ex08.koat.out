YES(?, x^51 + 4)

Initial complexity problem:
1:	T:
		(Comp: 1, Cost: 1)    f1(x) -> Com_1(f2(x^3))
		(Comp: ?, Cost: 1)    f2(x) -> Com_1(f3(x^17))
		(Comp: ?, Cost: 1)    f3(x) -> Com_1(f4(x))
		(Comp: ?, Cost: 1)    f4(x) -> Com_1(g(x))
		(Comp: ?, Cost: 1)    g(x) -> Com_1(g(x - 1)) [ x > 0 ]
	start location:	f1
	leaf cost:	0

Repeatedly propagating knowledge in problem 1 produces the following problem:
2:	T:
		(Comp: 1, Cost: 1)    f1(x) -> Com_1(f2(x^3))
		(Comp: 1, Cost: 1)    f2(x) -> Com_1(f3(x^17))
		(Comp: 1, Cost: 1)    f3(x) -> Com_1(f4(x))
		(Comp: 1, Cost: 1)    f4(x) -> Com_1(g(x))
		(Comp: ?, Cost: 1)    g(x) -> Com_1(g(x - 1)) [ x > 0 ]
	start location:	f1
	leaf cost:	0

A polynomial rank function with
	Pol(g) = V_1
and size complexities
	S("g(x) -> Com_1(g(x - 1)) [ x > 0 ]", 0-0) = x^51
	S("f4(x) -> Com_1(g(x))", 0-0) = x^51
	S("f3(x) -> Com_1(f4(x))", 0-0) = x^51
	S("f2(x) -> Com_1(f3(x^17))", 0-0) = x^51
	S("f1(x) -> Com_1(f2(x^3))", 0-0) = x^3
orients the transitions
	g(x) -> Com_1(g(x - 1)) [ x > 0 ]
weakly and the transition
	g(x) -> Com_1(g(x - 1)) [ x > 0 ]
strictly and produces the following problem:
3:	T:
		(Comp: 1, Cost: 1)       f1(x) -> Com_1(f2(x^3))
		(Comp: 1, Cost: 1)       f2(x) -> Com_1(f3(x^17))
		(Comp: 1, Cost: 1)       f3(x) -> Com_1(f4(x))
		(Comp: 1, Cost: 1)       f4(x) -> Com_1(g(x))
		(Comp: x^51, Cost: 1)    g(x) -> Com_1(g(x - 1)) [ x > 0 ]
	start location:	f1
	leaf cost:	0
