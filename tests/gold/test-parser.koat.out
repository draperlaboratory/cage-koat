YES(?, x^3 + x^2 + x + 1)

Initial complexity problem:
1:	T:
		(Comp: 1, Cost: 1)      start(x, y) -> Com_1(g(x, 0))
		(Comp: ?, Cost: x^2)    g(x, y) -> Com_1(f(x, y)) [ x = 0 ]
		(Comp: ?, Cost: 1)      g(x, y) -> Com_1(g(x - 1, y + x)) [ x > 0 ]
	start location:	start
	leaf cost:	0

A polynomial rank function with
	Pol(start) = V_1
	Pol(g) = V_1
	Pol(f) = V_1 - 1
orients all transitions weakly and the transition
	g(x, y) -> Com_1(g(x - 1, y + x)) [ x > 0 ]
strictly and produces the following problem:
2:	T:
		(Comp: 1, Cost: 1)      start(x, y) -> Com_1(g(x, 0))
		(Comp: ?, Cost: x^2)    g(x, y) -> Com_1(f(x, y)) [ x = 0 ]
		(Comp: x, Cost: 1)      g(x, y) -> Com_1(g(x - 1, y + x)) [ x > 0 ]
	start location:	start
	leaf cost:	0

Repeatedly propagating knowledge in problem 2 produces the following problem:
3:	T:
		(Comp: 1, Cost: 1)          start(x, y) -> Com_1(g(x, 0))
		(Comp: x + 1, Cost: x^2)    g(x, y) -> Com_1(f(x, y)) [ x = 0 ]
		(Comp: x, Cost: 1)          g(x, y) -> Com_1(g(x - 1, y + x)) [ x > 0 ]
	start location:	start
	leaf cost:	0

Complexity upper bound x^3 + x^2 + x + 1
