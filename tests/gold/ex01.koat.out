YES(?, 4*n + 3*x + 3)

Initial complexity problem:
1:	T:
		(Comp: 1, Cost: 1)    start(n, x) -> Com_1(f(n, x))
		(Comp: ?, Cost: 1)    f(n, x) -> Com_1(f(n, x + 1)) [ x < n ]
		(Comp: ?, Cost: 1)    f(n, x) -> Com_1(g(n, x)) [ x <= n /\ x >= n ]
		(Comp: ?, Cost: 1)    g(n, x) -> Com_1(g(n - 1, x)) [ n > 0 ]
	start location:	start
	leaf cost:	0

A polynomial rank function with
	Pol(start) = 2*V_1 - V_2 + 1
	Pol(f) = 2*V_1 - V_2 + 1
	Pol(g) = V_1
orients all transitions weakly and the transition
	g(n, x) -> Com_1(g(n - 1, x)) [ n > 0 ]
strictly and produces the following problem:
2:	T:
		(Comp: 1, Cost: 1)              start(n, x) -> Com_1(f(n, x))
		(Comp: ?, Cost: 1)              f(n, x) -> Com_1(f(n, x + 1)) [ x < n ]
		(Comp: ?, Cost: 1)              f(n, x) -> Com_1(g(n, x)) [ x <= n /\ x >= n ]
		(Comp: 2*n + x + 1, Cost: 1)    g(n, x) -> Com_1(g(n - 1, x)) [ n > 0 ]
	start location:	start
	leaf cost:	0

A polynomial rank function with
	Pol(start) = V_1 - V_2
	Pol(f) = V_1 - V_2
	Pol(g) = V_1 - V_2 - 1
orients all transitions weakly and the transition
	f(n, x) -> Com_1(f(n, x + 1)) [ x < n ]
strictly and produces the following problem:
3:	T:
		(Comp: 1, Cost: 1)              start(n, x) -> Com_1(f(n, x))
		(Comp: n + x, Cost: 1)          f(n, x) -> Com_1(f(n, x + 1)) [ x < n ]
		(Comp: ?, Cost: 1)              f(n, x) -> Com_1(g(n, x)) [ x <= n /\ x >= n ]
		(Comp: 2*n + x + 1, Cost: 1)    g(n, x) -> Com_1(g(n - 1, x)) [ n > 0 ]
	start location:	start
	leaf cost:	0

Repeatedly propagating knowledge in problem 3 produces the following problem:
4:	T:
		(Comp: 1, Cost: 1)              start(n, x) -> Com_1(f(n, x))
		(Comp: n + x, Cost: 1)          f(n, x) -> Com_1(f(n, x + 1)) [ x < n ]
		(Comp: n + x + 1, Cost: 1)      f(n, x) -> Com_1(g(n, x)) [ x <= n /\ x >= n ]
		(Comp: 2*n + x + 1, Cost: 1)    g(n, x) -> Com_1(g(n - 1, x)) [ n > 0 ]
