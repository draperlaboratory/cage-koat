YES(?, 1)

Initial complexity problem:
1:	T:
		(1, 1)    f(x) -> Com_1(g(x))
		(?, 1)    g(x) -> Com_1(h(x))
	start location:	f
	leaf cost:	0

Repeatedly propagating knowledge in problem 1 produces the following problem:
2:	T:
		(1, 1)    f(x) -> Com_1(g(x))
		(1, 1)    g(x) -> Com_1(h(x))
	start location:	f
	leaf cost:	0

Complexity upper bound 1
