YES(?, a + b + 1)

Initial complexity problem:
1:	T:
		(Comp: 1, Cost: 1)    start(a, b) -> Com_1(one(a, b))
		(Comp: ?, Cost: 1)    one(a, b) -> Com_1(one(a - 1, b)) [ a > b ]
	start location:	start
	leaf cost:	0

A polynomial rank function with
	Pol(start) = V_1 - V_2
	Pol(one) = V_1 - V_2
orients all transitions weakly and the transition
	one(a, b) -> Com_1(one(a - 1, b)) [ a > b ]
strictly and produces the following problem:
2:	T:
		(Comp: 1, Cost: 1)        start(a, b) -> Com_1(one(a, b))
		(Comp: a + b, Cost: 1)    one(a, b) -> Com_1(one(a - 1, b)) [ a > b ]
	start location:	start
	leaf cost:	0

Complexity upper bound a + b + 1
